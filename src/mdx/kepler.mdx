  You discredit my oval path. I hold up to you the hundred-times-more-absurd spirals of the ancients (which Tycho imitated by not setting up anything new but letting the old things remain). If you are angry that I cannot eliminate the oval path, how much more ought you to be angry with the spirals, which I abolish. It is as though I have sinned with the oval I left behind, even though to you all the rest of the ancients do not sin with so many spirals. This is like being punished for leaving behind one barrow full of shit although I have cleaned the rest of the Augean stable.

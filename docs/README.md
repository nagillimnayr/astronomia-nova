Astronomia Nova is a VR Solar System simulation created for the Douglas College Physics and Astronomy Department to be used as an educational tool. The web application allows users to view the positions of planets in the sky from the perspective of the surface of any planet in the Solar System. Its main purpose is to visualize the apparent retrograde motion of planets from the perspective of planets other than the Earth.

## 'Astronomia Nova ΑΙΤΙΟΛΟΓΗΤΟΣ seu physica coelestis, tradita commentariis de motibus stellae Martis ex observationibus G.V. Tychonis Brahe'
### (New Astronomy, reasoned from Causes, or Celestial Physics, Treated by Means of Commentaries on the Motions of the Star Mars, from the Observations of the noble Tycho Brahe)

'Astronomia Nova' is the title of the book by Johannes Kepler where he published his first two laws of planetary motion:
1. The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
